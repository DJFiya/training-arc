# GitHub Training Repository

This repository is intended as a massive workspace for practicing, training, and solving programming problems. It serves as a sandbox for learning new concepts, experimenting with code, and building solutions to a variety of challenges.

Current goals for this repo:
- Tackle python DSA problems, that I needed help with to optimize
- Work on Odin Project Web Dev Items
- Practice using Django DB and Backend
