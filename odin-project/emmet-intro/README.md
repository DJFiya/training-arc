# Emmet Intro

This project is part of The Odin Project curriculum.  
The goal is to learn and practice using Emmet.

## What is Emmet?

Emmet is a plugin for many popular text editors that allows you to quickly generate HTML and CSS code using short abbreviations.

## Lesson Notes

- I generated the base HTML file by typing `!` and pressing Enter, which is an Emmet abbreviation for a boilerplate HTML document.
- I configured shortcuts for "Wrap with Abbreviation" and "Remove Tag" Emmet commands to speed up editing.

## Task

- Practice using Emmet abbreviations to speed up your workflow.
- Try generating HTML structures and CSS rules using Emmet in your editor.
